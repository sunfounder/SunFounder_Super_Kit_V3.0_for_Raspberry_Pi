Lesson 3 Flowing LED Lights
=============================


Introduction
---------------

In this lesson, we will learn how to make eight LEDs blink in various
effects as you want based on Raspberry Pi.

Components
-------------

\- 1 \* Raspberry Pi

\- 1 \* Breadboard

\- 8 \* LED

\- 8 \* Resistor (220Î©)

\- Jumper wires

\- 1 \* T-Extension Board

\- 1 \* 40-Pin Cable

Principle

**Principle**: Judging from the schematic diagram, we can know that a
LED and a current-limiting resistor have been connected to B17, B18,
B27, B22, B23, B24, B25, and B4 respectively. The current-limiting
resistor has been connected to the 3.3V power supply on other side.
Therefore, if we want to light up one LED, we only need to set the GPIO
of the LED as low level. So in this experiment, set B17, B18, B27, B22,
B23, B24, B25, and B4 to low level in turn by programming, and then
LED0-LED7 will light up in turn. You can make eight LEDs blink in
different effects by controlling their delay time and the order of
lighting up.

Experimental Procedures
-------------------------

**Step 1**: Build the circuit.

**Step 2:** GPIO4 is the default pin for onewire driver (w1-gpio). In
this lesson, we need to disable the onewire function and use it as an
output pin.

.. code-block::

    sudo nano/boot/config.txt

Commit the following line.

.. code-block::

    #dtoverlay=w1-gpio

For C Language Users:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Step 3:** Open the code file.

.. code-block::

    cd/home/pi/SunFounder_Super_Kit_V3.0_for_Raspberry_Pi/C

.. note::
    
    Use the cd command to switch to the code path of this experiment.

**Step 4:** Compile the Code.

.. code-block::

    gcc 03_8Led.c -o 03_8Led -lwiringPi

**or**

.. code-block::

    make 03_8Led

.. note::
    
    *gcc* is a linux command which can realize compiling and generating the C language program file **03_8Led.c** to the executable file **03_8Led**.
    
    *make* is a linux command which can compiling and generating the executable file according to the rule inside the makefile.

**Step 5:** Run the executable file above.

.. code-block::

    sudo ./03_8Led

.. note::
    
    Here the Raspberry Pi will run the executable file *03_8Led* compiled previously.

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: C
    
    void Led_on(int channel)
    { /* This is a subfunction with a formal parameter
    int channel for importing the numbers of the controlled pins. Its
    function body is digitalWrite(channel, LOW); Set the I/O port of channel
    as low level(0V), the LED on this port lights up. void led_off(int
    channel) is to turn off the LED. Setting function simplifies the input
    for the repeated content.*/

        for(i=0;i<8;i++)
        { //make 8 pins' mode is output

            pinMode(i, OUTPUT);

        }
        /*The cathodes of the 8 LEDs connect to B17, B18, B27, B22, B23, B24,
        B25, and B4 of the T-shape extension board respectively, corresponding
        to 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. It is to set the 8 LEDs as output separately. Use
        for loop to make it more concise and efficient.*/

        for(i=0;i<8;i++)
        { //make LED on from left to right

            Led_on(i); // turn the LED i on

            delay(100); // keep the LED i lighting for 100ms.

            Led_off(i); // Turn the LED i off

        } 
        /* Light up and turn off the LEDs in GPIO0~7 successively. i increases
        progressively from 0 to 7, LED0 to LED7 changes accordingly, making it
        like a flowing LED light from left to right.*/

        for(i=;i>=0;i--)
        { //make LED off from right to left

            led_on(i); // turn the LED i on

            delay(100); // keep the LED i lighting for 100ms

            led_off(i); //turn the LED i off
        }
    }
    /* In this for loop, light up and turn off the LED in GPIO7 to GPIO0 successively, 
    making a flowing LED light from left to right.*/

For Python Users:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Step 3:** Open the code file.

.. code-block::

    cd/home/pi/SunFounder_Super_Kit_V3.0_for_Raspberry_Pi/Python

**Step 4:** Run.

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 03_8Led.py

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: python

    LedPins = [17, 18, 27, 22, 23, 24, 25, 4] '''The cathodes of the 8 LEDs
    connect to B17, B18, B27, 22, 23, 24, 25, 4 of the T-shape extension
    board. In BCM, these pins are corresponding to 17, 18, 27, 22, 23, 24,
    25, and 4.'''

    leds = ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-', '-'] 
    # the array to print out the status of the 8 LEDs

    for pin in LedPins: 
    # Assign the element in pins list to pin variable one by one. 
    # In GPIO.setup (pin, GPIO.OUT), set the pins in list as output one by one.

        GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.LOW) 
        # Set each element in the pins list as low level to light up the LEDs

        leds[LedPins.index(pin)] = 0 # Show which LED is on

        time.sleep(0.1) # wait for 0.1s

        GPIO.output(pin, GPIO.HIGH)) 
        # After delaying, set it as high level to light up or turn off the LED.

        leds[LedPins.index(pin)] = '-' # Show the led is off

You will see the eight LEDs lighten up one by one, and then dim in turn.
